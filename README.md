![TODO: Update the path with the name of your diagram](Automated-ELK-Stack-Deployment/Diagrams/Updated Network Diagram.PNG)

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. 
They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above or alternatively, 
select portions of the *-playbook.yml file(s) may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.
